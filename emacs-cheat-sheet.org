* TODO

A better way to scroll/find/go to a location outside the
window. Scrolling is only useful when I want to skim/scan a file top
to bottom, otherwise it is very distracting and tiring.

Push and pop location in a unified way. Return from xref definition,
return from previous mark, etc.

Built-in features as alternative to helpful features, such as list of
references, source code, etc.

Better navigation between helpful buffers, forward and backward. It's
not desired that a second help buffer opens in the other window. Help
buffers don't have this problem.

Goto help at point, like 'M-.'. And return, like 'M-,'.

Run C-h m in Help/Helpful buffer and check mode specific key bindings.

Separate "selection" and "adding a location to mark ring". I don't
want the mark to be saved every time text is selected.

Stop Ivy matching when necessary. For example, there is an existing
file design-top.v, typing C-x C-f top.v ENTER opens design-top.v
rather than creating top.v.

Save as another file with single command.

write-file replaces the buffer with the buffer that visits the new
file. Keep both buffers.

Change tiling of windows from vertical to horizontal and vice versa.

Swiper commands. swiper-thing-at-point

Isearch forward and backward together.

Avy.

highlight-regexp and unhighlight-regexp

Emacs pull request scroll-margin > 0 together with follow-mode.

Syntax of regular expressions.

C-s for all project (like grep -r)

Many commands opens a buffer in other window but not move to it, such
as list-buffers. Moving to the newly opened buffer is often the
desired behavior.

Switch to *occur* buffer after creation.

Documentation page Choosing a "Window for Displaying a Buffer":
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Choosing-Window.html

Quitting temporary windows, such as help, with q.

ediff control panel opens as a new frame, rather than a secondary echo
area/minibuffer.

Easier way to cancel completion when tying. For example, I want to
type "buffer" and press ENTER, the completion suggests "buffers". The
ENTER selects the undesired suggestion rather than opening a new
line. One option is to hit SPACE and then ENTER, which leaves a
training space to the previous line. Solution: Insert new line with
C-j.

Alternatively, only use M-p, M-n, M-ENTER to navigate and select in
completion list, as with the default completion built-in Emacs. This
will also enable moving cursor up and down when the completion list is
open.

Sometimes when the point is at the end of a line, the line shifts
right by one column (line number included). Prevent it. In org-mode.

goto-line in another buffer.

Set Emacs C source directory.

undelete-frame-mode (version 29 or higher) to undelete recently
deleted frames with C-x 5 u.

Desktop library to save and restore sessions. I don't want automatic
restoring at startup. I only want the option to call smt like
restore-session in case I unintentionally quit Emacs, or kill frame.

Some messages in echo area disappears after some seconds. Disable this
(or extend the duration) so that I can take as much time as possible
when reading it.

Configure/learn tab bars (similar to i3 workspaces) not to use the bar
but be accessible via commands.

Non-agressive parenthesis insertion. For example, I don't want the
closing paranthesis to be inserted after I type the openning
paranthesis; but I want emacs to put closing paranthesis to the third
line, put the point to the second line and indent.

Text alighment left (default with M-q), center, and right. Solution
for center: M-x center-{line,region,paragraph}.

Company vs builting completion.

Outline mode vs org mode.

Org mode manual.

Tex mode vs auctex.

Make M-; insert the comment after a single space, rather than a
TAB-like distance.

Which-key mode doesn't work with Ivy. Builtin feature for which-key?

Disable electric layout mode for any buffer. Some modes, such as C and
Verilog, enables this by default, which is very annoying.

Hideshow mode vs selective display vs outline mode vs foldout package.

Built-in version control (VC) vs projectile.

Built-in project commands vs projectile.

diff-hl mode to highlight uncommited changes in the margin. Is there a
built-in method?

Treemacs vs built-in speedbar.

Don't highlight spelling errors when mouse is on it.

Update start-emacs according to emacsclient options in
manual. --reuse-frame

Built-in method for kill buffers when killing frame?

Revise emacs.org to replace features provided via packages with
built-in ones.
